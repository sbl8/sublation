# Compiler Refactoring Summary

## Issue Resolved

Successfully refactored the `compiler/compiler.go` file to eliminate cyclomatic complexity violations that were preventing golangci-lint from passing.

## Functions Refactored

### 1. `parseSpec()` - Reduced from complexity 36 to under 15

**Before:** Monolithic function with nested switch statements, error handling, and iterate block processing.

**After:** Extracted into smaller, focused functions:

- `dslParser` struct for state management
- `parseLine()` for line routing
- `parseIterateBlock()` for iterate constructs
- `processSimpleLine()` for basic directives
- `parseNodeLine()` and `parsePayloadLine()` for specific parsing
- Helper functions: `parseIterateParams()`, `collectBlockLines()`, `expandIterateBlock()`, etc.

### 2. `writeCompiledGraph()` - Reduced from complexity 19 to under 15

**Before:** Sequential binary writes with individual error checking.

**After:** Extracted into structured components:

- `binaryWriter` struct for output management
- `writeHeader()` for metadata
- `writeNodes()` and `writeNode()` for node serialization
- `writeNodeFields()`, `writeNodeTopology()`, `writeNodePadding()` for granular control
- `writePayload()` for aligned payload output

### 3. `Compile()` - Reduced from complexity 16 to under 15

**Before:** Chain of file operations with individual error handling.

**After:** Simplified flow with helper functions:

- `loadAndParseSpec()` for input processing
- `writeSimpleGraph()` for output generation
- `simpleWriter` struct for the original binary format
- Granular functions: `writeSimpleHeader()`, `writeSimpleNodes()`, etc.

## Architecture Principles Maintained

✅ **Pure Go only** - No external dependencies introduced
✅ **Zero allocations after start** - Refactoring preserves memory efficiency
✅ **Performance-focused** - No reflection or `interface{}` in hot paths
✅ **Elegance over cleverness** - Functions are now more readable and focused
✅ **Cache-aligned operations** - Binary layout optimizations preserved

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Code Quality**: All functions now under 15 cyclomatic complexity threshold
2. **Maintainability**: Each function has a single, clear responsibility
3. **Testability**: Smaller functions are easier to unit test
4. **Readability**: Logic flow is more transparent
5. **Performance**: No runtime performance degradation
6. **Compliance**: golangci-lint now passes for compiler package

## Testing Verification

- ✅ All existing tests pass without modification
- ✅ Binary compatibility maintained
- ✅ DSL parsing behavior unchanged
- ✅ File format output identical

## Files Modified

- `compiler/compiler.go` - Refactored three high-complexity functions
- No breaking changes to public API
- No changes to test files required

## Next Steps

The compiler package now passes golangci-lint complexity checks. The remaining complexity issues are in other packages (runtime, model, arena) and can be addressed separately if needed.
